## Overview

This is a hands-on workshop template for AI Ship 2025 that teaches you how to refactor AI applications from traditional patterns to modern, secure, and scalable approaches using the latest Vercel AI SDK v5 features. The workshop focuses on migrating to best practices including agents, workflows, structured outputs, and AI Elements.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** - React framework for production
- **AI SDK 5** - Vercel's AI SDK with modern agent patterns
- **shadcn/ui** - Beautiful, accessible component library
- **AI Gateway** - All AI providers in one place
- **AI Elements** - Pre-built UI components for AI interactions
- **Upstash KV** - Redis-compatible storage for workflows
- **Workflows SDK** - Long-running async operations
- **Vercel Sandbox** - Secure code execution environment

## Prerequisites

Before starting the workshop, ensure you have:

- âœ… React knowledge
- âœ… Next.js experience
- âœ… v0 Account
- âœ… Vercel Account
- âœ… Vercel AI Gateway API key
- âœ… GitHub Account
- âœ… Node.js and pnpm installed

## Development (after you have cloned the template!!)

Run the development server:

```bash

pnpm install
vercel link
vercel env pull
pnpm dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your application.

Test the application with "iPhone" in the brand input field.

## Workshop Tasks

### Phase 1: Initial Setup

- [ ] Clone workshop template from v0.dev into your personal workspace
- [ ] Connect your v0 project to GitHub and create new repository
- [ ] Deploy project from v0 to Vercel and verify deployment
- [ ] Clone GitHub repository to your local machine
- [ ] Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies
- [ ] Run `vercel link` to link your local project to vercel project
- [ ] Set up environment variables with `vercel env pull`
- [ ] Test the application locally with `pnpm dev`

### Phase 2: Refactor to AI SDK v5

- [ ] Import `Experimental_Agent as Agent` and `Output` from `ai` package
- [ ] Refactor `create-brand-context` API route to use Agent class with `experimental_output: Output.object()`
- [ ] Add system prompt to create-brand-context Agent
- [ ] Create Zod schema for brand context structured output
- [ ] Ensure contextData matches `BrandContext` type from `upstash.ts`
- [ ] Refactor `generate-questions` API route to use Agent class with structured output
- [ ] Add system prompt to generate-questions Agent with brand name restrictions
- [ ] Create validation tool that checks for brand mentions in questions
- [ ] Configure Agent with `stopWhen: stepCountIs(3)` for max 3 steps
- [ ] Update Agent system prompt to instruct calling validateQuestions tool
- [ ] Remove manual validation check and trust Agent tool validation
- [ ] Ensure questions match `Question[]` type from `upstash.ts`
- [ ] Refactor `check-visibility` API route to use Agent class
- [ ] Add system prompt to check-visibility Agent for brand detection
- [ ] Create Zod schema for brand detection with `isVisible` and `position` fields
- [ ] Ensure answerData matches `VisibilityAnswer` type from `upstash.ts`
- [ ] Test all three API routes with brand name input

### Phase 3: CLI Agent Flow (Streach Goal)

- [ ] Install `@next/env` package for environment variable loading
- [ ] Create `lib/envConfig.ts` with `loadEnvConfig` from `@next/env`
- [ ] Create `scripts/full-agent-flow.ts` to import `envConfig` at the top
- [ ] Use types from `lib/upstash.ts` and `lib/constants.ts`
- [ ] Create `checkVisibility` function with `Promise.allSettled` for parallel execution
- [ ] Test CLI script locally with `pnpm full-agent-flow iphone run222`
- [ ] Verify all 27 checks run in parallel
- [ ] Confirm results are stored in Redis with the correct runId

### Phase 4: Vercel Sandbox Integration (Streach Goal)

- [ ] Install `@vercel/sandbox`, `ms`, and `@types/ms` packages
- [ ] Create `app/api/full-flow-agent/route.ts` endpoint
- [ ] Configure Sandbox to clone from GitHub repository
- [ ] Set Sandbox resources to 4 vCPUs and 10 minute timeout
- [ ] Pass all required environment variables to `runCommand` (not Sandbox.create)
- [ ] Run `pnpm install` in Sandbox with environment variables
- [ ] Execute `pnpm full-agent-flow <brand> <runId>` in detached mode
- [ ] Do not use `sandbox.stop()` to keep sandbox running until completion
- [ ] Update `app/page.tsx` to call `/api/full-flow-agent` instead of 3 separate routes
- [ ] Remove unused `MODELS` import from `page.tsx`
- [ ] Update button text to indicate Sandbox execution
- [ ] Test locally with `vercel env pull` for OIDC token
- [ ] Test endpoint with `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/full-flow-agent -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"brand": "iphone"}'`
- [ ] Verify frontend polling displays results in real-time

### Phase 5: Sync and Deploy

- [ ] Push changes to GitHub main branch
- [ ] Sync v0 with GitHub to pull latest changes
- [ ] Verify deployment on Vercel production
- [ ] Test production Sandbox endpoint
- [ ] Monitor sandboxes in Vercel Dashboard Observability tab
- [ ] Test production application end-to-end

## Stretch Goals

Once you've completed Phase 1-5, try these advanced challenges:

### UI enhancements

- [ ] Integrate AI Elements into results display
- [ ] Use v0 to generate chart components for visualization
- [ ] Add interactive data visualizations to results

### Advanced: Security & Performance

- [ ] Implement BotID for bot detection and prevention
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware to API routes
- [ ] Configure Vercel Firewall or Upstash rate limiting
- [ ] Monitor and log API usage patterns

### Advanced: SaaS Features

- [ ] Add Stripe for payment processing
- [ ] Claim Stripe Sandbox account
- [ ] test Stripe payment processing in Stripe dashboard

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure you have `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` environment variable set in `.env.local`
- Make sure youhave REDIS connected in v0 and then do `vercel env pull` to pull the environment variables into your local environment.
